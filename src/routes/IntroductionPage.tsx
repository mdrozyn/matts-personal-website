            <p>Hello World!</p>
            <p>My name is Matt Drozynski and I am a Web Developer from Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>From the time I was young, I was fanscinated with technology. Watching my older cousins play video games was intersting and I wanted to learn more.</p>
            <p>As a teenager, I developed an interest in guitar playing and music recording which eventually led me to move to Philadelphia to immerse myself in the music culture and to attend Temple University.</p>
            <p>Since graduating, I began working in the software development industry for over 4 years.</p>
            <p>Thanks for checking out my website!</p>
